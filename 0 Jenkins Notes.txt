Jenkins Runs on port 8080 by default.


Jenkins is an **open-source automation server** widely used in **software development** to automate parts of the **build, testing, and deployment process**. It helps developers integrate changes to projects more easily and deliver software reliably and quickly — this practice is known as **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**, or simply **CI/CD**.

### 🧩 What Jenkins Is

* **Jenkins** is a **Java-based automation tool**.
* It can **build, test, and deploy** your code automatically.
* It supports **plugins** for almost any technology — Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Maven, etc.
* It provides a **web interface (dashboard)** for managing automation jobs.

---

### 🚀 How Jenkins Helps in Software Development

#### 1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**

* Every time a developer pushes code to a repository (like GitHub), Jenkins:

  * Pulls the latest code.
  * Builds the application.
  * Runs automated tests.
* This ensures that code changes don’t break the project.

✅ *Example:*
When a developer commits code, Jenkins automatically builds and runs tests — if something fails, the developer gets notified immediately.

---

#### 2. **Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)**

* After successful builds and tests, Jenkins can **automatically deploy** the software to:

  * A staging environment (for testing)
  * Or directly to production servers.

✅ *Example:*
When all tests pass, Jenkins can deploy the updated web app to a cloud server or container without manual intervention.

#### 3. **Automation of Repetitive Tasks**

Jenkins can automate tasks like:

* Compiling source code
* Packaging binaries (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`, `.zip`)
* Running unit or integration tests
* Generating reports (coverage, build status)
* Sending email or Slack notifications

---

#### 4. **Pipeline as Code**

* Jenkins allows you to define **pipelines** in code (`Jenkinsfile`).
* You can version-control your CI/CD process along with your source code.

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps { echo 'Building...' }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps { echo 'Running tests...' }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps { echo 'Deploying application...' }
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### 5. **Integration with Tools**

Jenkins can integrate with:

* **Version Control Systems:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
* **Build Tools:** Maven, Gradle, npm
* **Testing Frameworks:** JUnit, Selenium, pytest
* **Cloud/Container Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure

### ⚙️ Jenkins Workflow Summary

1. **Developer commits code** → GitHub
2. **Jenkins detects change** (via webhook or schedule)
3. **Jenkins builds** the application
4. **Runs tests**
5. **Packages artifacts**
6. **Deploys** to testing or production environment
7. **Reports results** (email/Slack/dashboard)

---

### 🏁 Benefits

* Early detection of integration issues
* Faster feedback for developers
* Automated deployment → fewer human errors
* Centralized build and deployment process
* Scalable and customizable with plugins
