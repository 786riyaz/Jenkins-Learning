To create a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and AWS, I usually start by setting up Jenkins on an EC2 instance. After installing Java and Jenkins, I open port 8080 so I can access the Jenkins dashboard.

Next, I connect Jenkins with my GitHub repository using the Git plugin, so every time I push new code, Jenkins automatically triggers a build.

Then, I create a Jenkins pipeline with stages like checkout, build, test, and deploy. In the build stage, Jenkins installs dependencies and runs tests to make sure everything works properly.

Once the build is successful, Jenkins deploys the application to AWS — depending on the project, it could be to an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, or even Elastic Beanstalk.

Finally, I set up automation triggers and notifications, so the whole process — from code push to deployment — happens automatically.

This ensures faster delivery, fewer manual steps, and a reliable continuous integration and deployment process.
